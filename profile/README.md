# SASjs - DevOps for SAS

The SASjs Framework is both a collection of tools and an approach to project delivery, designed to accelerate the development and deployment of solutions on ALL flavours of SAS (Viya, EBI, Base).

Everything in SASjs is MIT open source and free for commercial use.  It's backed by the team at [4GL Apps](https://sasapps.io), who are happy to assist with support, project deliveries, or framework extensions.
