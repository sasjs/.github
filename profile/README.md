# SASjs - DevOps for SAS

The SASjs Framework is both a collection of tools and an approach to project delivery, designed to accelerate the development and deployment of solutions on ALL flavours of SAS (Viya, EBI, Base).

Everything in SASjs is MIT open source and free for commercial use.  It's backed by the team at [4GL Apps](https://sasapps.io), who are happy to assist with support, project deliveries, or framework extensions.

The framework also underpins, and is used extensively by, [Data Controller for SASÂ®](https://datacontroller.io) - a free web app for controlled business data capture that works on ALL SAS platforms (Viya, EBI, Base). 

If you'd like to touch base with other SASjs users, and ourselves, you are free to join our public [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#sasjs:4gl.io).

*Note:* The SASjs project and its repositories are not affiliated with SAS Institute.
